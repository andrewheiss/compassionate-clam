# Introduction

ONGO law, what has it meant for ONGOs—how are they responding?

@FaridLi:2021

Charity law + ONGO law happened at the same time - lots of discussion about what it would mean for ONGOs at the time - lots of people looked at the framework of the law, but we don't know what it has actually looked like
Following up with the actual implementation of law



# Context of the ONGO law

How the law works, what it looked like pre-2016/7


# Literature

## Literature on global crackdown on NGOs

Contentiousness, regime stability, other reasons


## Literature on implementation - de jure vs. de facto differences


## Literature on organizational flexibility



# Theory / research questions

- RQ1: Provinces and work field - connects to NGO contentiousness bc everything is noncontentious
- RQ2: Provinces and PSUs - local vs. national - there's variance in local PSUs - flexibility, venue-seeking maybe
- RQ3: Provinces and length of time in country / registration date/year - earlier organizations work in more? - flexibility bc more local knowledge, more interest, more support from government to get registered, etc.


# Data and methods

No control/pre-group - this is all descriptive about the "after" group of ONGOs that all selected themselves into the regulations



multiple_id - either treat it as a random organization effect for the parent org, or weight it, so if there are 8, we weight by 1/8
cn_background = Chinese NGOs


Main assumption: We're interested in the potential to be in other provinces, even if an organization is small now, they want to someday spread out


# Results


TODO: Oxfam and World Vision as short case studies?


# Discussion
